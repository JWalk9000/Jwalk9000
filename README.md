# About Me

Iâ€™m Jesse â€” a self-taught developer learning one day at a time with the help of AI tools.  
After nearly 30 years in construction and related industries, I shifted into IT and began teaching myself programming and system automation.

Iâ€™ve used Linux since the late 90s â€” first as a hobby and curiosity, and now as my daily driver on every machine I own.  
Most of my scripting and experimentation happens in **Bash**, with growing experience in **Python** and **Go**.  
I rely on AI assistance to help generate and refine code, but I make an effort to understand, test, and adjust everything I use.

Iâ€™ve completed courses in **Python**, **cybersecurity**, and through **IBM SkillsBuild**, and continue to learn by building practical, open-source tools and solving real problems as I go.  
I know Iâ€™m still early in my journey, but I take care with what I share and welcome any feedback or guidance from others.
