# About Me

Iâ€™m Jesse â€” a self-taught developer learning one day at a time with the help of ML/LLM tools.  
After nearly 30 years in construction and related industries, I shifted into IT while continuing to pursue learning in programming and system automation.

Iâ€™ve used Linux since the late 90s â€” mostly as a hobby and tool until the last few years, now I use it as my daily driver on every machine in my home.

Most of my scripting and experimentation has been in **Bash**, with growing experience in **Python** and **Go**. 
I lean heavily on LLM assistance to help generate and refine code. This allows my to try many ways of to accomplish something very quickly that would otherwise take weeks or months to slog through.
Doing things this way I am able to learn and understand the code faster, then I test and adjust to zero in on what I want.

Iâ€™ve completed courses online courses in **Python**, and **cybersecurity** through **IBM SkillsBuild**, and I continue to learn by building practical, open-source tools for solving real challenges I come accross.  
I know Iâ€™m still early in my journey and i have a LOT to learn. I do my best to take care with what I share and welcome any feedback or guidance from others.
